It can be lonely at the top. As one of the rarest personality types - and one of the most capable - they know this all too well. Rational and quick-witted, they pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves, not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. But because their minds are never at rest, they may struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them."

This personality type is fairly rare, but with their creativity and inventiveness, they aren't afraid to stand out from the crowd."

They gather information to construct their creative visions but rarely hesitate for long before acting on them. they are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, they are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they've set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world - but we have they to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day."

They pursue their goals vigorously despite any resistance they might encounter. Quick-witted and audacious, they aren't afraid to disagree with the status quo. In fact, they're not afraid to disagree with pretty much anything or anyone.

Instead, people with this personality type are knowledgeable and curious, with a playful sense of humor, and they can be incredibly entertaining. They simply have an offbeat, contrarian idea of fun - one that involves a healthy dose of spirited debate."

ESTPs always have an impact on their immediate surroundings - the best way to spot them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy of people flitting about them as they move from group to group. Laughing and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, ESTP personalities love to be the center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come on stage, ESTPs volunteer - or volunteer a shy friend. Theory, abstract concepts and plodding discussions about global issues and their implications don't keep ESTPs interested for long. ESTPs keep their conversation energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is - or better yet, to just go out and do it. ESTPs leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go, rather than sitting idle, preparing contingencies and escape clauses."
